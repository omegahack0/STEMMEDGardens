# Project Name: STEMMED Gardens 

# Problem:
Food scarcity during globally impacting negative events like pandemics and social unrests causes distress amongst people.  Starting a home food producing garden can help alleviate household food insecurities by providing home grown food as well as reducing the strain on retail food sources by increasing the food supply if micro food sourcing is done on a macro level.  There are many issues to starting a new garden though, given the complexities of geographical climate zones, plant species types, plant diseases, pests, containers, soil composition, invasive species, and plant identification just to name a few.  Traditional ways of researching the best garden methods by inexperienced gardeners usually involves spending significant amounts of time searching the internet randomly for anecdotal or research-based evidence but the results may vary wildly from user to user. 

# Solution: 
For a more efficient and successful gardening experience, we propose to provide a portable gardening platform that combines gamification, research based meta-analysis, artificial intelligence, and user success distillation algorithms to isolate variables for new gardeners to easily use for their specific gardening conditions.  An easier-to-use platform that leverages crowd sourced gardening experiences with a seamless technical backend can easily increase harvest yields, gardener satisfaction, increase environmental awareness, and at the same time reduce food insecurities in communities throughout the world.
